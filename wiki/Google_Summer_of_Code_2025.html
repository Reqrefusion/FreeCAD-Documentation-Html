<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_it_works">How it works</span></h2>
<ul><li>The student writes a project proposal for FreeCAD, and uploads it the GSoC platform.</li>
<li>Students can choose to work on their own idea, or they can pick an idea suggested by the FreeCAD mentors team. There is no difference in how your project is reviewed or accepted, the important part is to work on something you like.</li>
<li>Proposals will be reviewed, evaluated, and ranked by FreeCAD mentors.</li>
<li>Google allocates a certain number of slots to each participating organization. Slots are allocated following the ranking order given by the project mentors.</li>
<li>If you are accepted, You will have two FreeCAD mentors assigned to you. there is a first period allocated to get to know FreeCAD, the community and your mentors, then the real coding period starts. Your work get reviewed at mid-term and at the end.</li></ul>
<p>If you want to get involved, <b>study well the <a href="GSoC_Checklist.html" title="GSoC Checklist">GSoC Checklist</a></b>. Whether you're applying or accepted, we've itemized everything you need to do in this list. We're here to help you become new open source developers, so don't be shy if you have any questions.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_your_proposal">Writing your proposal</span></h2>
<p>We are proposing a number of project ideas here. But you are in no way forced to follow our ideas. You can propose anything you would like to work on, that you thing would be an interesting project. Good places to hunt for ideas are the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AFeature">list of feature requests</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org">FreeCAD forum</a> or other FreeCAD communities, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.facebook.com/FreeCAD">Facebook</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://discord.com/invite/w2cTKGzccC">Discord</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freecad">Reddit</a>.
</p><p>You will find many templates and models on the internet, and on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code website</a>, but it does not need to be very elaborate. Again, what is important is that you choose a subject you like. It's more important to get interested in your idea and do some research about how you would achieve it than writing very long proposals.
</p><p>What we expect to see in your proposal is what is explained on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code website</a>. Additionally, we want to see that you did your research, and that you explored FreeCAD enough so we can trust you know what you are going into.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Selection_Process">The Selection Process</span></h2>
<p>GSoC is about getting people involved and contributing to open source over the long-term. As such, we heavily weight our application selection process towards students that are interested in remaining involved in FreeCAD and open source software development after GSoC has ended. GSoC is not a summer job, although it happens during the Northern hemisphere summer months and requires some dedication and commitment, like a job.
</p><p>Additionally, submissions are ranked based on perception of the submitter's abilities to complete the task within the program time frame, general consensus on the technical approach being proposed, and overall interest in having such modifications made to FreeCAD. Particular notice is made of students that are responsive to questions and readily interactive with the FreeCAD community, mainly through the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org">FreeCAD forum</a>. Communication is a great thing. Having a forum account already, and having already discussed your idea there, for example under the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46&amp;sid=c47dc0459f8be0c52e072a8de66c8738">GSOC section</a>, is a great way to have people interested in your project.
</p><p>Just about every GSoC organization receives considerably more project proposals than can be accepted. Every application gets read multiple times and reviewed in detail. Of those applications, only a small subset are selected so keep in mind that the selection process is rather competitive.
</p><p>Whether or not you are accepted, contributing to open source outside of GSoC is one of the main goals of the program and is the best way to be noticed and get your proposal accepted. Keep that in mind. Thanks for your interest and we look forward to working with new FreeCAD developers!
</p><p>And in case your proposal is not accepted but you would still like to work on it, nothing prevents that! Several FreeCAD GSoC students in the past have worked on their project outside the GSoC program.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Possible_Mentors">Possible Mentors</span></h2>
<p>The pool of mentors will review all the proposals, each member will mark the proposals they want to mentor, and each winning proposal will get the mentors that marked their interest. There is no need for you to choose a mentor yourself before starting. If you would like to get reviewing and mentorship before starting, look for the mentors from previous years in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46">GSoC section of the FreeCAD forum</a>, or simply post something in that section to ask for review.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation_Ideas">Implementation Ideas</span></h2>
<p>There are several sources for project ideas. The table below lists existing project ideas already picked by the FreeCAD developers. FreeCAD also previously participated in an umbrella organization for GSoC, and there are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+FreeCAD">FreeCAD project ideas available in their GSoC repo</a>. Additionally, there is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=84897">forum thread</a> calling for additional ideas which may be the basis of a project.
</p><p>The ideas listed here or in the OpenCAx repo serve mostly as inspiration, and do not have a higher chance of being accepted as project proposal. You are totally free to build your own idea, specially for students with an established involvement in FreeCAD who have already contributed code. Feel free to contact us on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=84897">forum</a> for further discussions about the listed projects.
</p><p>The size column shows the estimated time frame to complete the project, but you are of course free to suggest otherwise if you see arguments for it. Clicking on each idea will get you to its corresponding GitHub issue, which will contain more details and where you can ask questions.
