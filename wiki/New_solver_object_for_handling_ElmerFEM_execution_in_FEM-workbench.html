<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outline">Outline</span></h2>
<p>This GSoC project aims at building a first bridge between FreeCAD and ElmerFEM. The intension is to use FreeCAD for geometrical modeling and basic preprocessing and ElmerFEM as external solver, since the graphical user interface of ElmerFEM called ElmerGUI is no more active developed. 
</p><p>A new solver object has to be implemented based on existing objects. The execution of ElmerSolver is handled by this new solver-object from within FreeCAD.  All solver-specific information is provided by an externally generated solver-input-file which has to be selected with a proper graphical user interface. The definition of boundaries and domains inside the model is done by using existing FEMMesh-Groups while presenting the user supportive information extracted from the provided solver-input-file.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Details">Details</span></h2>
<ol><li>Get familiar with FreeCAD, how 3D-models are built up, and how elements of this models can be access via python-console.</li>
<li>Get familiar with  ElmerSolver, ElmerGUI  to set up basic simulation models and solver-input-files.</li>
<li>The student has to be familiar with pre- and postprocessing related to numeric simulations.</li>
<li>Existing solver objects for other solvers like CalculiX have to be adopted to handle Elmer-specific settings.</li>
<li>All mesh related definitions is done using existing tools in FreeCAD’s FEM-workbench.</li>
<li>The evaluation of the simulation output in done in Paraview.</li>
<li>Basic GUI-elements have to be introduced to handle the externally provided solver-input-file for running the simulation with ElmerSolver.</li></ol>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Expected_Outcome">Expected Outcome</span></h2>
<ol><li>A easy to use solver-object and self-explaining dialogs for handling all external Elmer-related processes</li>
<li>Test runs ensuring the functionality</li>
<li>Documentation and tutorials for the workflow</li></ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Future_Possibilities">Future Possibilities</span></h2>
<p>Since the integration of external solvers is a huge area in constant evolution, the work done in this GSoC will only cover a small part of it. But if the bases are done right, extending them will be easy and could develop very far.
