<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outline">Outline</span></h2>
<p>FreeCAD already possesses a vast documentation, written by its users and hosted on this very wiki. On each FreeCAD release, the contents of the wiki get packed into a offline documentation package which is bundled with FreeCAD. When using the "what's this?" feature, FreeCAD users can quickly get documentation about a specific tool
</p><p>Additionally, this same documentation also has several translations, hosted on the same wiki and managed by a mediawiki plugin, and also counts on the source code structure and comments, automatically extracted by the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen" rel="nofollow">doxygen</a> tool, and hosted on <a class="external free" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/api/" rel="nofollow">https://www.freecadweb.org/api/</a>
</p><p>However there are several problems:
</p>
<ul><li>The bundled offline doc is often incomplete, due to the difficulty (and size) to pack it all</li>
<li>Over a year there are significant differences between the online and offline docs</li>
<li>Translations are not available offline</li>
<li>The doxygen-generated docs are in a bad state, hard to read and use and don't explain APIs clearly, and confuse C++ and python</li>
<li>The wiki is hard to port and back up</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons" rel="nofollow">Add-ons</a> documentation is not well integrated</li></ul>
<p>Additionally, the mediawiki-based documentation is more and more problematic to maintain and back up, and we are looking at transitioning to a more easily portable and redundant system like git-based wikis.
</p><p>This project proposes to remedy to the main problems by:
</p><p>- allowing the user to switch between online and offline documentation, and choose between different available languages
- extending and bettering the doxygen-generated documentation, with special care for the python API
</p>
<ul><li>proposing a better Doxygen structure for <a class="external free" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/api/" rel="nofollow">https://www.freecadweb.org/api/</a> possibly with interconnection with the wiki</li></ul>
<p>- working on bettering the current wiki (formatting, linking between pages, navigation, etc)
- reimplement the old workbench-defined documentation system, help porting the different addons
- adapt the FreeCAD start page to it
- adapt the FreeCAD help menu (integrate workbenches and addons help entries)
- exploring the different possibilities of git-based documentation, analyzing specially their user-friendliness and ease of edition, and possibilities of maintaining large translations easily and automatically (for ex. connecting with translation platforms) and propose migration workflows
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Details">Details</span></h2>
<ul><li>Get familiar with FreeCAD and the contents of the wiki</li>
<li>Successfully compile FreeCAD (you'll be working in C++) and the Doxygen docs</li>
<li>Understand how Doxygen works and specifically how it treats C++ and Python differently</li>
<li>Work on the FreeCAD C++ source code (modify the whats'this and documentation system, work on the Help menu)</li>
<li>Work on the in-source code documentation</li>
<li>Work on the wiki documentation</li>
<li>Explore and document available open-source documentation systems</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Expected_Outcome">Expected Outcome</span></h2>
<ul><li>A better documentation system inside FreeCAD</li>
<li>Documentation. Like all open-source projects, it is of uttermost importance to document a lot everything you do. This allows for other people to take on and extend your work more easily.</li>
<li>Proposals of migration to a better documentation system that would still keep FreeCAD users happy and eager to write and translate</li></ul>
